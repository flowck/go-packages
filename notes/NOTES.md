# Notes

## What is a package?

## How does a package look from the Filesystem view?

All the files inside a single directory.

## Rules

* The package declaration must match the folder's name

## The main package

* It defines a system's entrypoint, and contains the `main()` function.
* It focuses on the system's initialisation.
